# Element-Runes

Element-Runes is a project for Colony-Overcast on their journey to learn event-entity system of game development. This is not a serious project, so expect hiatus, meme materials, and abandon. Element-Runes is written in Typescript using various libraries, as well as some unconventional coding styles. We hope you visitors to be kind on Colony-Overcast's journey.
